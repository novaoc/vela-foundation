# The storefront ships enabled, and its central promise is that a visitor
# with no account can go from the catalog to the checkout page. Each hop
# here depends on the previous page's real markup, a session cookie the
# browser carries itself, and a Turbo form submission, so a broken link,
# an unclickable button, or a lost cart session fails the test.
#
# The final submit is deliberately not clicked: it hands off to Stripe, and
# the suite makes no network calls.
